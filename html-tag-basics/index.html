        <h3>Paragraph tag</h3>
        <!--this is the coding block for your context on your webpage-->
        <p>The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line 
            in your displayed web page on the browser. The browser does NOT 
            display your context in the physical style of how you have entered 
            your code in your HTML file.
        </p>
        <P> This is my second paragraph on the displayed browser page. It will start 
            a new line.
        </P>
        <!--If you wish to use a component of a reversed tag (or a whole tag) you would be in 
        trouble just using the tag
        you can use special characters to represent components of a tag such as the < (&lt) and the (&gt) > symbol-->
        <h3>List tags &lt ol &gt and &lt ul &gt </h3>
        <!--create an ordered list using the ol tag
        Items in the list are li tags-->

            <li>Close and reopen VS-Code</li>
            <li>look at the bottom right corner on the blue status line for Go Live</li>
            <li>This will run your page from VS-Code</li>
            <li> alter the page and save the file (ctrl + s), your browser will automatically
                be updated

        <ul>
            <li>This is an unordered list</li>

        <!--this is an anchor tag often reffered to as the link tag
            one should NOT use the term link tag as this is a <link> tag used in the <head> section
