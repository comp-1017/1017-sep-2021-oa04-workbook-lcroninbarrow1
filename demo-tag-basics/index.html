    <h1>Markup Demo</h1>
    <p>There are many ways to make a presence on the web and a website is just one of them. Other types of
        web presence include social media channels and sites that allow customers to review your business.
        Before you start making a website, make sure you understand what’s provided by the different types of
        web presence and the costs and benefits associated with each type.</p>
    <h3>Try Photoshop</h3>
    <p>Photoshop is part of Creative Cloud and comes with Adobe CreativeSync, so your assets are always at your
        fingertips right when you need them. CreativeSync powers your Creative Cloud Libraries and Adobe Stock,
        and it connects your mobile and desktop apps.</p>

    <h3></h3>
    <!--Image tag does not have a closing tag
    refered to as a self closing tag (or a void tag)
    Paramerters
        src="relative web site location"
        alt="printable text if img not found"
        [titles="tool tip text for img"]

        the relative path is from the top of your website down to the item you wish to reference
            include all subfolder names and the final file name
            sf1/sf2/......../fn

    <h3>Quality guidelines</h3>
    <p>These quality guidelines cover the most common forms of deceptive or manipulative behaviour,
        but Google may respond negatively to other misleading practices not listed here. It's not safe to
        assume that just because a specific deceptive technique isn't included on this page, Google
        approves of it. Webmasters who spend their energies upholding the spirit of the basic principles
        will provide a much better user experience and subsequently enjoy better ranking than those who
        spend their time looking for loopholes they can exploit.</p>
    <h3>Champions League Quarter Finals</h3>
    <p>A strange enough start, though. Mitroglou prances down the Benficaright and fires a low cross into
        the Bayern box. It’s a decent delivery, but there’s nobody there to take a shot on goal. Bayern
        clear, and Ribery dances down the left again. He feeds Douglas Costa down the channel. Douglas
        Costa stands one up to the far post, and Vidal heads home into the right-hand portion of the net
        with the greatest of ease from six yards!</p>

    <!--Another way to display an image is using the figure tag along with the figcaption tag
    the figure tag will indent your image while the fig caption tag will allow you to place
    a text line with your image
    the figcaption tag is optional -->

    <figure><img scr="img/photoshop.jpg" alt="photoshop logo" title="this is a tool tip">
        <figcaption>Note where this caption text for the image appears</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <!--using an image anchor for your page-->
